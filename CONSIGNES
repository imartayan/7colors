This is the template of the 7 wonders of the world of the 7 colors assigment. 


The game template is split in several files (that you will modify and extend):
 - board.h: Header file of a board module.
 - board.c: Implementation file of a board module (+some tests at the end).
 - main.c: Main function of the game.
 - (feel free to add more modules here if appropriate)
 
The compilation infrastructure adds another file:
 - CMakeLists.txt: declaration of the source files, binaries and compilation rules.

The testing infrastructure adds 2 source files, that you probably won't modify:
 - test.c: Main function of the testing infrastructure. 
 - simple_unit_test.h: Header of the testing infrastructure, to be
   imported in all modules' implementation when you add tests.


The file 7colors-static, also provided in this archive, is an
executable version of our implementation, that you should be able to
run on any Linux 64 bits system.


To initialize your project, simply type  : cmake . # only once
Then to recompile everything, simply type: make    # every time
To run all unit tests, type              : ./tests # after recompiling
