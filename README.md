# 7colors
An implementation of the 7 colors game written in C.

## Project structure
* board.c: gestion of the board (random generation, update, print...)
* main.c: main function of the game
* queue.c: queue data structure with linked lists

## Done
* generate the board
* naive search of accessible colors
* list and queue structure
* correctly handling colors
* better propagation function
* 2 players mode
* better update function using BFS

## Todo
* create a random player
* create a greedy player
* create a tournament
* write documentation (duh)
* write a detailed report
* (improve artificial intelligence (minimax ?))
